## About me

I am a dynamic, persistent, and focused leader with a proven track record as a CTO and Head of Engineering. My core mission is to lead high-performing technology organizations, aligning technical strategy directly with business objectives to accelerate Product-Market Fit (PMF). I thrive on bridging the gap between strategic vision and technical execution.

My foundation is rooted in Software Architecture (MIT certified) and Advanced Computer Engineering (MBA). I leverage this expertise with a deep technical skillset that includes: C#/.NET, JavaScript, Node.js, SQL/PostgreSQL, AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, and Datadog. My industry expertise spans Leadership, Team building, Security, and particularly, Scalability.

My professional journey provided the essential hands-on experience, evolving from a QA professional to a Solutions Architect. This background is critical for my leadership roles, allowing me to guide teams in designing and creating robust, highly scalable systems. My strategic achievements include leading a team of 5 people during a cloud migration and working on distributed, high-performance solutions serving approximately 40% of the electronic market nationwide.

I view people management and communication as paramount to successful engineering leadership. I focus on enhancing skills, organizing processes to guarantee the quality of our deliveries, and translating complex technical visions to non-technical stakeholders. As a co-founder, I learned the value of LEAN thinking and avoiding the pitfall of seeking perfection in the first version, skills that drive my efficient project execution today.

Beyond my career, I am a husband and a father of two daughters with autism. This constant requirement for focus, resilience, and problem-solving mirrors my professional drive. I am a dedicated scholar who genuinely enjoys studying, learning new things, and facing challenges, which fuels my commitment to continuous improvement and innovation.
