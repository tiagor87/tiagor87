## About me

I am a very persistent and focused person, I go to great lengths to achieve the goals I set in the best possible way. Besides, I'm a scholar, I'm always trying to improve myself. In my free time, when I am not with my family, I am studying, or  both, as I said, I love studying and I believe that knowledge is never too much.

I started my career developing Flash sites with my brother as a freelancer. Some time later, I was called to work in a small development company, where I had a deeper contact with programming, which made me choose Computer Science at the College. Then, I had my first opportunity in a large company, where I played a very important role as QA, working directly on test automation in their ERP product line. A year later, I participated in a selection process and won the position of trainee programmer using the Delphi programming language. During the time I was in this company, I managed to climb step by step, always offering my best, reaching web / mobile programmer, professor of internal courses and solutions architect, designing some new modules.

When I didn't see any more opportunities for growth, I decided to look for a new challenge. So, together with two friends, we opened N4Works, a services company focused on web / mobile and consulting. It was quite a learning experience that contributed a lot to my personal and professional growth. Unfortunately due to some mistakes we made, we closed it.

I am currently a C# backend technical leader in Mundipagg company, developing distributed and high performance solutions, which serve about 40% of the eletronic market nationwide. I also work as a professor of web development, database and object orientation at the university where I graduated.

## Professional History

### UniFESO - Since 2020

I started teaching at the beginning of 2020 and it has been quite a challenge, mainly due to the Covid-19 pandemic. I had to learn and relearn several things, class setup, communication, assessment, CBT guidance and a lot of other things. I have really enjoyed the experience.

### Mundipagg - Since 2018

At Mundipagg I entered the position of specialist developer, but in a short time I took on a leadership position, which has proved to be a real challenge, due to the number of people with very different thoughts and also by the business offered in the company. I have been looking to improve my skills to provide better and clearer feedbacks, in addition to organizing processes that guarantee the quality of our deliveries.

### Nibo - Between 2017 to 2018

Here I learned the real meaning of LEAN and to seek results with the least possible effort.

### N4Works - Between 2013 to 2017

I started the company with 2 more friends, we dreamed of developing a system in the health area. However, we made the mistake of looking for the "perfect" in a first version and because of that, we were never able to actually publish and sell the system. This experience contributed to my growth in managing people and creating more LEAN thinking for projects.

### Alterdata - Between 2007 to 2013 and 2017

Initially as QA, I was responsible for automating e2e tests in Desktop applications developed in Delphi 7. When a selection process for a developer opened, I decided to take a risk, and just over a year after joining the company, I assumed the position of developer. After that, I reached new positions and became one of those responsible for starting the company's migration to the cloud. At that time I was at the head of a team with 5 people counting on me.
